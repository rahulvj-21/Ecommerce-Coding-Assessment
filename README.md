# Ecommerce (React) Coding Assessment

## Overview

I have created the Login page but due to some flaws in the code I'm unable to browse route the links hence I just created the product page and the cart page.

## Application Functionalities
1. Use of Hooks is very prominent and can be seen at multiple location. Hooks like useState, useNavigate, useEffect has been used.
2. React Router Dom is been used to browse between different pages of the website. 
3. Functions and Component has been used to create different functionalities.
4. CSS is used for styling along with javascript.
5. Lambda functions has also been used in some places to do some mapping of items or to evaluates some conditions.
6. HeaderList component is holding the code for the navigation bar, CartList.jsx component is having the code for the cart page and the ProductList.jsx component holds all the product description from where products can be added to cart.

If I were allocated more time I would have developed it completly and surely a better version of it. More dynamic effect can be added in the frontend using javascript. User Registration page can also be created but for that we need to connect a inmemory database or maybe sql database according to our ease.
